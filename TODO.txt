- introduce document representations for subjects and objects (types: uri & record)

- About Plugin
-- repository: find all statements for subject => apply in template
-- content negotiation in controller => check header and set response format
-- offset, count and content degotiation for subject list

-- json-ld templates

- Add new type Resource Representation for object?
-- use for 303 redirect to html?

- transfer stuff from CVMA to vocabulary ext

- switch wizard_add to 'script' and test editing

- vocabulary
-- is the tablename field really needed since prepend_tname doesn't have any effect?
-- first test with statements for any record
--- check how hard it is to integrate a makeLodifiable => quite hard, integrated later (@see CategoryRegistry)

- default templates for
-- showSelectedTerms
-- showSelectedVocabulary

- create new wizards at predicate + subject selects in statement table
- create new wizard at possibly all select fields

- RDF serializer => condense statements in RDF/XML + TTL output

- bnodes
-- uuid generator for bnodes
-- table 'bnodes' => keeps uuids that can be reused as subjects/objects, have a BE title and are unique in the system
-- bnodes could be made available via suggest wizard besides the value field

- object value field could also have a wizard for subject/object creation

- write some helpful repository methods to retrieve values from s/p/o's
-- maybe from a view helper?

- FLUID
-- generate namespaces in template dynamically from all used
